- commerce will drive the change and regulationization of the internet
	- ads taking up a lot of spaces?

- using code as the digital alternative to laws and regulations seems vague. what is code?

- In speaking of a constitution in cyberspace we are simply asking: What values should be protected there? What values should be built into the space to encourage what forms of life? (pg 6)

- parallels between post totalitarian Eastern bloc seeking "anarchy" and post govt west seeking the internet 

- fixing problems with code or making choices within the code constraints in cyberspace? Similar to changing laws or living within laws

- surveillance is becoming easier and less burdensome on targets, should govt increase surveillance as a result?

-issue is cyberspace eliminates physical geography, which makes question of which rules apply, more difficult
  - commerce helps solve this issue from its need for geo-targetted ads

- authentication is needed for real space and cyber space to better the regulations in those spaces

Creating an identity layer on internet----
- individuals gain control to data, commerce and govt can more easily sell/distro info
	- but indivs lose anonymous speech, and govt/commerce lose access to data collection on indivs 



CH 5-6 
- govt should regulate a small volume of distributers to indirectly regulate mass audiences

- making something regulable seems to be a way to allow govt to access the info so future regulations may be imposed on behavior

- ideal goal is to build a system that maintains traceablity, but only traces with proper judicial action, similar to concept of worm in storage

- creating regulation in code is like a locked door blocking access by existence - architecture

- games like second life have become a commerce-like influencer in cyberspace regulatory architecture


CH 7-9
- laws, social norms, the market, and code can all "regulate"
	- in cyberspace, code is a strong mode of regulation, so power struggle over who controls code

- open source software may seem unsafe, but control is still in hands of a few

- markets also favor closed products, so open SW, while less regulable, can still less widespread

- cyberspace is not the same as physical, so laws must be appropriately applied to prevent over or under reach of govt


Ch 10

- traditional IP laws meant to spur innovation by giving creators temp monopolies
	- goal was to eventually return them to public for societal greater good

- code is much more adherent to ownership, ex: not much flexibility using fair use to copy songs

- companies are incentivized to crack down on their DRM violations to make profits, decreasing the free useability of much content online

- shift towards a permission culture from free, can potentially stifle creativity due to fear of DRM prosecutions 




CH 11

- surveillance has become cheaper due to the ease of doing it in cyberspace

- market and govt have incentives to surveil: for profits, and law enforcement respectively

- question of whether anonymity is valued or ability to truly authenticate someone is valued more

- US has more culture of letting markets regulate cyberspace, but EU passes more laws to regulate

- since code is law, code must be scrutinized like any bill being passed



CH 12-13

- first amendment applies only to physical space, but framers could not have envisioned this, debate on where it now applies

- private ISPs end up regulating speech like govt, even though not required by constitution

- we must decide who decides speech freedom in cyberspace, got, private entities, or the people

- speech takes different forms online vs in person. How to decide how this speech gets reinterpreted under the same laws governing both spaces 


CH 14 - 15

- can be confusing on who has sovereignty over cyberspace, since it is not bound by geography

- physical connections (ISPs, data centers,ec) are where governments can regulate cyberspace

- nations can have competing interests that cause different cyberspace regulation laws, which can resditribute cyberspace demand to different countries

- competition can be risky and further fragment the internet, or unify it and promote privacy 


CH 16-18

- the loss of digital freedoms is happening behind the scenes, and many are unaware to the changes

- increasing cyberspace regulation decreases choice and anonymity 

- Lessig suggests a constitution of sorts for cyberspace, developed by coders and lawmakers and citizen involvement

- Lessig rebuts Declan McCullagh by claiming that a lack of action in regulating code will cause private powers to take over control of cyberspace

- instead public oversight is necessary, he argues, to ensure transparent and accountable regulation









Goldman & Sibley, Sections I - III 

- Orwell's "memory hole" from 1984 can serve as a good analogy of modern copyright misuse, which results in society's loss of knowledge and truth

- copyright is easier to enforce with takedowns of content and US law also protects this behavior

- copyright laws being used to protect privacy and reputation are against the original intent of copyright laws, which were meant to spread info not suppress

- there are a few real world cases where copyright laws were weaponized against critics, used to hide info from public, and change records of events




Goldman & Sibley, Sections IV - V 

- privacy and copyright can intersect in four applications: protection of private physical spaces, autonomy over ones own body, privacy for personal opinions, control over personal data

- but the need for privacy must not facilitate stronger copyright laws, as this risks using copyright for censorship

- one way to curb copyright misuse is to set a time limit on its term, so that descendents can't make claims for ancestor's works

- another way is for courts to interpret a copyright case in favor of fair use if it documents a factual or socially significant event, meaning such data cannot be taken down by copyright
